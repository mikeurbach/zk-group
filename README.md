# ZK::Group

A Group implementation for ZK. Why do you need ZK::Group? You have a bunch of services? One might even be so bold as to call it "a cluster" (especially in the presence of CTOs or investors)? 

If you'd like to know:

* Who is in the group
* When the members of the group have changed
* What changed about the list of members

Then ZK::Group is the tool for you. Intentionally lightweight. Use it as-is or subclass and extend for _even more fun_.
